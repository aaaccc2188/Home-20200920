# **Case Study: Stripe - Payments for Developers**

![Logo](Images/image.jpg)

## **Overview and Origin**
- Stripe is a San Francisco-based fintech and SaaS company which provides APIs that developers can use to integrate payments processing into websites and mobile applications. The company has expanded its product offerings into other areas such as online billing, card issuing, fraud prevention etc.

- Stipe was founded in 2010 by two Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison when they were 22 and 20 years old. In 2007, the brothers co-founded Shuppa which later merged with Auctomatic and developed software to manage and list items for sale on online marketplaces such as eBay; a year later they sold the company for $5 million.

- While the two brothers were working on Auctomatic, the realized that payments are the single biggest challenge for developers when they build online businesses. This was the early days of e-commerce, while for many consumers the experience wasn’t awful, almost all developers complained that payments processing are the hardest capability to add.

- The brothers built a prototype in 2009, and in 2010 Stripe was seeded by Y Combinator. Shortly after in May 2011, they received funding from backers including Peter Thiel, Sequoia Capital, and Andreesen Horowitz. Today Stripe is a global leader in online payments processing. As of Apr 2020, the company was valued at $36 billion. It remains a private company as of today.

## **Business Activities**
- In 2009, setting up a payments system for online businesses was extremely burdensome. It was usually considered as a vendor selection decision and involved many businesspeople such as accounting and legal. Many of the decision-makers had zero knowledge about the technical difficulty of the integration process. As a result, these solutions could sometimes take up to a few months to implement.

- The problem was so acute that the Collison brothers couldn't believe why no one else had attempted to solve. They soon concluded that this use case was at the cross-roads of several domains including technology, financial institutions, and regulations, which was so complex that most start-ups did not have the appetite for. Even the biggest fintech at the time, PayPal, wasn't solving the use case for businesses, they were only interested in consumers. That was probably why Peter Thiel, the co-founder of Paypal, wrote a check immediately after his meeting with the Collison brothers.

- In contrast, the prototype of Stripe was only several lines of code. It took them another two years to hire experienced businesspeople and worked with many industry players, and officially launched in 2011.

- Today, Stripe’s customers include a range of customers from start-ups, SMBs, to enterprises. Their target segments include:
  - E-commerce and retail, such as OpenTable, Target
  - B2B platform such as Shopify, Xero
  - SaaS such as Splunk, DocuSign
  - B2C marketplace such as Lyft, DoorDash
  - Non-profit such as UNICEF

- Stripe has also expanded thier product offerings, which includes:
  - Payments processing
  - Billing: subscriptions, and invoicing
  - Payouts: payments for platforms and marketplaces
  - Terminal (POS)
  - Radar: fraud prevention
  - Sigma: business data and analytics platform
  - Atlas: registration, tax, and legal services)
  - Card issuing
  - Lending

- Although Stripe was not the first company to enable online payments, the company’s core competency is focused on providing simple, easy-to-implement APIs to developers built by developers. The customers love thier product because it has great documentation, clear pricing, and is secure, reliable, and super easy to set up; effectively reducing the integration process to a couple days from several months. In addition, from the beginning, the company has adopted a partner vs. compete approach when they build their business. They hired sophisticated businesspeople to build partnerships with legacy financial institutions, payment networks, and regulators, banks, consumer wallets etc. As a result, they are able to offer thier clients a much more streamlined and faster onboarding process than legacy players.

- Technology stack of Stripe includes:
  - Programming Languages: Ruby, Scala, Go, JavaScript and Swift on mobile
  - Client Libraries: Backbone.js, React
  - HTTP Server: HAProxy
  - Server Libraries: Sinatra
  - Databases: PostgreSQL, Hadoop, Redis
  - Server Software: Consul
  - Cloud Infrastructure: AWS

## **Landscape**
- Stripe primarily operates in the payments industry, and more specifically, online merchant acquiring payments. According to Goldman Sachs, there will be over $50 trillion in online payment volume by 2026, with $23 trillion shifting online over the next 10 years. According to Credit Suisse, there are $7.5 trillion in US card volumes in merchant acquiring payments. Of which, $1.3 trillion is from SMB and micro merchants, which represents 17% of volume but 55% of the acquiring/processing revenue.

- Legacy payment processors include Chase Paymentech Solutions and First Data, whose primary customers are traditional retailers. In addition to legacy players, Stripe competes primarily with Braintree/Paypal and Adyen. Braintree is focused on SMBs and large merchants; while Adyen is focused on enterprise customers (large, global, eCommerce and omnichannel).

- Outside US, companies such as Alipay and Tenpay have been extremely successful in capturing large market share in online payments volume. In recent years, fast growing e-commerce giants such as MercadoLibre and Sea are also developing their own payments platform.

## **Results**
- Since Stripe is a private company, they don’t disclose their payments volume. It is estimated that their volume is $200+ billion, slightly less than Braintree and Adyen. 

- Stripe charges a 2.9% fee on credit card payments and $0.30 per transaction, which translates into about $6 billion of revenue. Typically banks can charge up to 2.5% on payment volume, and what is left over will be Stripe's margin. The CEO has shared before that Stripe has better margins than most people assume, but without providing any more details.

- Stripe was valued at $36 billion in Apr 2020, compared to $30 billion of Adyen and $130 billion of Paypal (at Apr 2020, since then these two publicly traded companies had gained tremendsly in value and are valued at $54 billion and $200 billion respetively). But the value Stripe has created is more than just significant shareholder wealth, it has provided critical technology to enable to growth of e-commerce. 

  >“For years, the explosive growth of e-commerce has outpaced the underlying technology; companies wanting to set up shop have had to go to a bank, a payment processor, and “gateways” that handle connections between the two. This takes weeks, lots of people, and fee after fee.” — Ashlee Vance, Bloomberg Businessweek

## **Recommendations**
- In the last few years, Stripe has expanded their product offerings focused providing value-adding ancillary services to enable their clients to build online businesses. The company should continue to deepen their relationships. Nevertheless, these product offerings seem to be incremental versus strategic.

- The trend of large e-commerce companies to develop their own payment solutions will likely put competitive pressure on Stripe. The rise of social commerce allows social media giants such as Facebook to enter into e-commerce, and Facebook already has the ambition of developing Libra so it's hard to imagine that they will not develop their own payments network. It is like what Amazon does best - turn your cost into another product.

- On the other hand, one of the least disrupted areas of e-commerce and online payments remains in B2B. The B2B eCommerce opportunity is $12.2 trillion compared to $2 trillion for the B2C market. Similarly, the gloval B2B payments are $125 trillion versus $52 trillion in B2C markets. Currently, there is no dominant e-commerce/fintech player in either sectors.

- Stripe should leverage its competitive advantage to target this fast growing market with low penetration. The Collison brothers had experience in e-commerce and their focus on making building online businesses easy can also apply to B2B. One way to gain traction in this market is to partner with companies like BigCommerce that are more focused on B2B businesses compared to Shopify. Stripe should consider extending their existing partnership BigCommerce and even forming a joint venture to focus on B2B e-commerce/payments. Instead of defending their product when more and more e-commerce companies look for vertical integration, why shouldn't Stripe consider vertical integration?
